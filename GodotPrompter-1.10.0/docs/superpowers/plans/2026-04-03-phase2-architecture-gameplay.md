# GodotPrompter Phase 2 (Architecture & Gameplay) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create 10 Phase 2 skills covering Godot-specific brainstorming, debugging, architectural patterns (event bus, components, resources, DI), and gameplay systems (inventory, dialogue, AI navigation, cameras).

**Architecture:** Same as Phase 1 — independent markdown skill documents at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter. GDScript + C# examples (GDScript first). Godot 4.3+ minimum.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Godot 4.3+ API (GDScript + C#).

- Common Error Patterns table: "Node not found" (path wrong or not ready), "Null instance" (node freed), "Can't change state while flushing queries" (physics in wrong callback), etc. with fixes
- Performance Debugging: Profiler, Monitors, draw calls, physics ticks
- Scene Tree Debugging: print_tree_pretty(), remote scene tree, node groups
- GDScript-specific: @tool for live testing, _get_configuration_warnings()

### Task 3: event-bus skill

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/event-bus/SKILL.md`

Frontmatter: `name: event-bus`, `description: Use when implementing decoupled communication between nodes — global EventBus autoload with typed signals`

- When to Use vs Direct Signals: table (same parent→direct, unrelated nodes→event bus, UI updates→event bus, parent-child→direct)
- Basic EventBus implementation (GDScript + C#): autoload with typed signals (player_died, score_changed, level_completed, etc.)
- Connecting to Events (GDScript + C#): how consumers connect in _ready()
- Emitting Events (GDScript + C#): how producers emit
- Typed Signal Parameters: passing data with signals (health_changed(new_health, max_health))
- Anti-patterns: using event bus for everything (over-decoupling), event bus with side effects, circular event chains
- Testing Event Bus: how to test signal emission/reception
- Checklist

### Task 4: component-system skill

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/component-system/SKILL.md`

Frontmatter: `name: component-system`, `description: Use when building reusable node components — composition patterns, component communication, and interface design`

- Common Components table: HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, HurtboxComponent, InteractableComponent, StateMachineComponent
- Full HitboxComponent example (GDScript + C#): Area2D-based, signal on hit, damage amount, cooldown
- Full HurtboxComponent example (GDScript + C#): Area2D-based, connects to HealthComponent

- Approach Comparison table: Autoloads (simplest, global), @export injection (editor-wired), Service Locator (registered at runtime), Scene Injection (parent provides to children)
- Autoloads as Singletons (GDScript + C#): when appropriate (truly global state), dangers (hidden dependencies, test difficulty)
- @export Node Injection (GDScript + C#): inject dependencies via editor, most Godot-idiomatic approach
- Service Locator Pattern (GDScript + C#): ServiceLocator autoload with register/get, typed retrieval
- Scene Injection: parent sets dependencies on children in _ready()
- Testing with DI: swapping implementations for tests, mock-friendly design
- When to Use What: decision guide
