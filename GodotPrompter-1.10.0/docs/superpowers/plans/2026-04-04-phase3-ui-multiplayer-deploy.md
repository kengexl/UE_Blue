# GodotPrompter Phase 3 (UI, Multiplayer, Deploy, C#) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create 11 Phase 3 skills covering UI/UX, multiplayer networking, build/deploy pipelines, and C#-specific patterns.

**Architecture:** Same as Phase 1+2 — independent markdown skill documents at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter. GDScript + C# examples (GDScript first). Godot 4.3+ minimum.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Godot 4.3+ API (GDScript + C#).
