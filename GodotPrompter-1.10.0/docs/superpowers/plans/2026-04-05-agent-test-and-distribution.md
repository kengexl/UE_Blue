# Agent Integration Test & Distribution Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Validate GodotPrompter works end-to-end with AI agents, then publish v1.0.0 with polished docs and marketplace presence.

**Architecture:** Two sequential phases — agent test first (produces findings), then distribution (incorporates findings). Test plan is a markdown doc with structured prompts. Distribution is README update, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, git tag, and marketplace listings.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, Git, GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## Phase A: Agent Integration Test

### Task 1: Write Test Plan

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/agent-integration/TEST_PLAN.md`
- Create: `tests/agent-integration/RESULTS.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create test plan document**

Create `tests/agent-integration/TEST_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# GodotPrompter Agent Integration Test Plan

Run these tests in a **fresh Claude Code session** with GodotPrompter installed.
Record results in `RESULTS.md` after each test.

---

## Category 1: Cold Start (Installation & Discovery)

### Test 1.1: Plugin loads

**Setup:** Fresh Claude Code session with GodotPrompter installed.

**Prompt:** "What Godot skills are available from GodotPrompter?"

**Expected:**
- Agent loads `using-godot-prompter` skill (or reads it)
- Lists skill categories: Core/Process, Architecture, Gameplay, UI, Multiplayer, Build, C#
- Mentions at least 10 specific skill names

**Pass criteria:** Agent shows awareness of the skill catalog, not generic Godot advice.

---

### Test 1.2: Skill content access

**Prompt:** "What does the state-machine skill cover? Show me the approaches."

**Expected:**
- Agent reads `skills/state-machine/SKILL.md`
- Describes 3 approaches: enum-based, node-based, resource-based
- Shows the comparison table from the skill

**Pass criteria:** Response matches skill content, not generic FSM knowledge.

---

### Test 1.3: Cross-reference navigation

**Prompt:** "The state-machine skill mentions related skills. What are they?"

**Expected:**
- Agent finds the Related Skills line: player-controller, ai-navigation, resource-pattern
- Can describe what each related skill covers

**Pass criteria:** Agent navigates cross-references correctly.

---

## Category 2: Skill Discovery (Open-Ended Prompts)

### Test 2.1: State machine request

**Prompt:** "I need to add a state machine to my player character in Godot 4."

**Expected skill:** `state-machine`

**Expected behavior:**
- Loads the skill (not generic advice)
- Asks about complexity to recommend enum vs node vs resource approach
- Shows GDScript example from the skill
- Mentions C# equivalent

**Pass criteria:** Uses skill content, not generic FSM tutorial.

---

### Test 2.2: Project setup request

**Prompt:** "I'm starting a new Godot 4.3 project. How should I organize it?"

**Expected skill:** `godot-project-setup`

**Expected behavior:**
- Shows the split layout directory structure from the skill
- Recommends autoloads (GameManager, EventBus)
- Shows .gitignore template

**Pass criteria:** Directory structure matches skill exactly.

---

### Test 2.3: Enemy AI request

**Prompt:** "I want enemies that patrol waypoints and chase the player when they get close."

**Expected skill:** `ai-navigation`

**Expected behavior:**
- Shows NavigationAgent2D setup
- Provides patrol pattern with waypoints
- Shows chase behavior with state transitions
- References state-machine skill for FSM integration

**Pass criteria:** Uses NavigationAgent2D (not custom pathfinding), shows patrol code from skill.

---

### Test 2.4: Save/load request

**Prompt:** "Help me set up a save/load system for my Godot game."

**Expected skill:** `save-load`

**Expected behavior:**
- Shows strategy comparison table (ConfigFile, JSON, Resource)
- Recommends JSON for game saves
- Shows SaveManager autoload pattern
- Mentions version migration

**Pass criteria:** Shows the comparison table, recommends JSON with reasoning.

---

### Test 2.5: Code review request

**Prompt:** "Review this GDScript for common Godot issues." (paste a sample script with intentional anti-patterns)

**Sample script to paste:**
```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

var health = 100
var speed = 200

func _process(delta):
    var player = get_node("/root/Main/Player")
    if player:
        var dir = (player.position - position).normalized()
        position += dir * speed * delta

func take_damage(amount):
    health -= amount
    if health <= 0:
        get_parent().remove_child(self)
        queue_free()
```

**Expected skill:** `godot-code-review`

**Expected behavior:**
- Flags: untyped variables, using `_process` instead of `_physics_process` for movement
- Flags: hardcoded node path `/root/Main/Player` (use groups instead)
- Flags: `position +=` instead of `move_and_slide()` on CharacterBody2D
- Flags: `remove_child` before `queue_free` (unnecessary)
- Uses the checklist structure from the skill

**Pass criteria:** Finds at least 3 of the 4 issues, uses skill checklist format.

---

## Category 3: Full Workflow (End-to-End Build)

### Test 3.1: Project + Player

**Setup:** Empty directory, no existing Godot project.

**Prompt:** "Create a new Godot 4.3 project with a player that can move with WASD and attack with Space."

# GodotPrompter

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Godot 4.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-4.x-blue.svg)](https://godotengine.org)
[![Skills: 29](https://img.shields.io/badge/Skills-29-green.svg)](#available-skills)

Agentic skills framework for Godot 4.x game development. Gives AI coding agents domain-specific expertise for GDScript and C# projects.

## What is this?

GodotPrompter is a plugin that provides **skills** — structured domain knowledge that AI agents load on demand. When you ask your agent to "add a state machine" or "set up multiplayer", it loads the relevant GodotPrompter skill and follows Godot-specific best practices instead of relying on generic knowledge.

**29 skills** covering project setup, architecture, gameplay systems, UI, multiplayer, optimization, and C# patterns. All targeting Godot 4.3+ with both GDScript and C# examples.

## Quick Start

Install and use in under a minute:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jame581/GodotPrompter.git
claude plugins add ./GodotPrompter
```

Then ask your agent:
```
"I'm starting a new Godot 4.3 project. How should I organize it?"
```

The agent loads the `godot-project-setup` skill and provides a complete directory structure, autoload setup, and .gitignore — not generic advice.

## Supported Platforms

- [ ] **Step 1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md**

Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

```markdown
# Contributing to GodotPrompter

Thanks for your interest in contributing! GodotPrompter is an open-source skills framework for Godot 4.x. Here's how to add skills and improve existing ones.

## Adding a New Skill

### 1. Create the skill folder

```
skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md          # Required — main skill document
  *.md              # Optional — supporting references
```

Use **kebab-case** for folder names (e.g., `my-new-skill`).

### 2. Write SKILL.md with frontmatter

Every `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Use when [specific trigger] — [brief scope]
---
```

- `name` must match the folder name
- `description` should start with "Use when" to help agents decide when to load it

### 3. Structure your content

Follow this general structure:

1. **Title and intro** — What this skill covers, when to use it
2. **Related skills** — `> **Related skills:** **skill-a** for X, **skill-b** for Y.`
3. **Numbered sections** — Each major concept or pattern
4. **Code examples** — GDScript first, then C# equivalent
5. **Checklist** — Implementation checklist at the end

### 4. Code examples

- Include **both GDScript and C#** where applicable
- GDScript comes first, C# follows
- Use ` ```gdscript ` and ` ```csharp ` language tags (never `gd` or `cs`)
- Target **Godot 4.3+** APIs only — no deprecated methods
- Follow Godot style: snake_case for GDScript, PascalCase for C#

### 5. Cross-references

Add a related skills line after the intro paragraph:

```markdown
> **Related skills:** **event-bus** for decoupled communication, **component-system** for composition patterns.
```

Keep to 3-5 references max. Only link genuinely related skills.

## Improving Existing Skills

- Fix incorrect API references or deprecated methods
- Add missing C# examples where GDScript-only
- Add cross-references to related skills
- Expand checklist items
- Fix typos or unclear wording

## Testing Skills

Before submitting:

1. **Read through** — Does the skill make sense for someone new to Godot?
2. **Try the code** — Open Godot 4.3+ and verify examples compile and run
3. **Check C# parity** — Every GDScript example should have a C# equivalent (unless language-specific)
4. **Verify cross-refs** — Referenced skills must exist

## Conventions

- Skills must be self-contained and independently useful
- One skill per folder under `skills/`
- GDScript follows [Godot style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
- C# follows [Godot C# conventions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_style_guide.html)
- Target Godot 4.3+ minimum
- YAML frontmatter is required on every SKILL.md

## Questions?

Open an issue on GitHub or check existing skills for examples of the expected format.
