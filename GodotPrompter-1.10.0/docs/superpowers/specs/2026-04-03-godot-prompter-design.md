# GodotPrompter — Design Specification

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Status:** Complete (All Phases)

## Overview

GodotPrompter is an open-source, multi-platform agentic skills framework for Godot 4.x game development. It provides AI coding agents with domain-specific expertise for both GDScript and C# Godot projects.

## Goals

- Comprehensive Godot 4.x coverage across all skill levels (beginner to production)
- Support both GDScript and C# with examples for each
- Multi-platform: Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode
- Modular — each skill is independent and loads on demand
- Community-driven — easy for contributors to add individual skills

## Architecture: Modular Plugin

Single installable plugin with many independent skills inside. Skills only load when invoked, so there is no bloat penalty.

```

### Multi-Platform Strategy

- Skills written using Claude Code tool names as canonical reference
- Each platform gets a tool mapping file in `skills/using-godot-prompter/references/`
- Platform entry points (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.codex/INSTALL.md`) bootstrap the right context
- Bootstrap skill `using-godot-prompter` loads correct tool mapping at session start

### Naming Conventions

- Skill folders: kebab-case (`state-machine`, `player-controller`)
- GDScript examples: snake_case per Godot style guide
- C# examples: PascalCase per Godot C# conventions
- Godot 4.x API only

## MVP Definition (Phase 1 Complete)

Phase 1 is complete when:
- All 8 Phase 1 skills have SKILL.md files with working content
- Each skill has been tested with at least one pressure scenario (baseline fail → skill-loaded pass)
- Bootstrap skill correctly detects and maps tools for all 6 platforms
- README includes installation instructions verified on Claude Code and at least one other platform
- Design spec status updated to "Complete"

## Language Coverage Rules

- **Dual-language skills** (most skills): Include both GDScript and C# examples. GDScript example comes first.
- **Language-specific skills** (`csharp-godot`, `csharp-signals`): C# only, by definition.
- **Architecture skills** where the pattern is identical in both languages: Show GDScript, add a brief C# note only if the API differs.
- When a Godot API differs between GDScript and C# (e.g., signal connection syntax), always show both.

## Godot Version Target

- **Minimum: Godot 4.3** — this is the oldest 4.x version with a stable, mature API
- Skills should note when a feature requires a newer version (e.g., 4.4+)
- Do not use deprecated APIs even if they still work in 4.3

## Testing Strategy

- Skills tested using TDD approach (pressure scenarios with subagents)
- Baseline: verify agent fails without skill
- Green: verify agent complies with skill loaded
- Both GUT and gdUnit4 supported for Godot-side testing

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Plugin architecture | Modular (single plugin, many skills) | Proven pattern (superpowers), simple install, scales naturally |
| Tool name convention | Claude Code canonical | Largest user base, clean tool names, other platforms map from these |
| Godot version | 4.x only | 3.x is legacy, 4.x is the future |
| Language support | GDScript + C# | Covers both Godot communities |
| License | MIT | Maximum adoption |
| Testing frameworks | GUT + gdUnit4 | User choice, both well-maintained |
